<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Matthew, im 22 and I come from an itty bitty village in Kilkenny Ireland.
  I am a big gamer, and spend way too much time on my xbox, i work in McDonalds at the moment as an area leader.
  I got interested in coding not too long ago and have been doing that on the side when I can!!

</p>

<p>Some of the games i play on my xbox, are the borderlands series, i am one hell of a completionist and am trying to 100% all the borderlands with my boyfriend!
  As of right now though we are currently going through a minecraft phase.</p>

<p>I am a big dog lover, but weirdly we do have a cat, found her on the side of the road and took her in.
  Aside from that, im planning to continue with the coding, get into a bootcamp once ive saved up enough and hopefully branch out into the industry!!.</p>
